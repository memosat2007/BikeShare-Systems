# BikeShare-Systems
This project will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. We will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. We will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help visualize the data.
